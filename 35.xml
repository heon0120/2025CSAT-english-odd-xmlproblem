    <text>The expansion of sports tourism in the twentieth century has been influenced by further developments in transportation. Just as the railways revolutionized travel in the nineteenth century, so the automobile produced even more dramatic changes in the twentieth. ① The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically. ② Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain. ③ Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment. ④ The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the growth of locally based restaurants. ⑤ As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.</text>
